           From Buddhist Temples and Bullet Trains, to Sushi Bars and Video Games!

            Japan (or Nihon, as locals call it) is a beautiful concoction
            of time-honoured tradition, 
            
            <br>

            and a passionate drive towards
            technological advancement!
            
            <br>
            <br>
        
            If you're interested in fantastic cultural heritage sites,
            Japan has you covered:
            
            <br>

            Mount Fuji, the Itsukushima Shinto Shrine,
            and the Horyu-ji Buddhist monuments (which are some of the oldest
            surving wooden structures in the world!)

            <br>
            <br>
        
            Or if you're more interested in what modern Japan has to offer,
            the Ghibli Museum, Tokyo Skytree, and Nakano Broadway are must see
            stops on a Japanese vacation.

            <br>
            <br>

            If all this seems a bit too much, a helpful first stop
            might be Shinjuku to see one of Tokyo's most well known 
            tourism ambassadors: Godzilla!
